# Predicting the risk of CHD
Bayesian network that guarantees the best results in predicting the risk of CHD (coronary heart disease)

## ðŸ¤” What is this?
**Description:**  Cardiovascular diseases are the number one cause of death worldwide; around 17.9 million people die each year, which represents 31% of all deaths worldwide. Cardiovascular diseases are
a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels and include coronary heart disease (CHD), cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease, and other conditions. Thus, CHD continues to
be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among adults. It is a disease of the blood vessels supplying the heart, i.e., the heartâ€™s blood supply is blocked or interrupted by a build-up of fatty
substances in the coronary arteries. Hence, we intend to predict a 10-year risk of CHD in patients using Bayesian networks. The original data are from a large cohort from the BioLINCC website.

The **main goal** of this project is to implement a Bayesian network that guarantees the best results in predicting the risk of CHD. Thus, you need to learn a Bayesian network for a  dataset.


## ðŸ“š Data

Data with the projects (to obtain and validate the Bayesian Network) are in data dir.
 
The original data are from a large cohort from the BioLINCC website.

The dataset has 15 features (without considering the target variable). If you are experiencing memory problems in learning your Bayesian network, you can do a feature selection and select
the most relevant ones.


##  ðŸš€ Quick Install


copy data (in data dir) `CHD_dataset.csv` to the same dir then the solution 'Predicting the risk of CHD (Chronic Heart Disease) BayesianNetwork.ipynb'.

Run 'Predicting the risk of CHD (Chronic Heart Disease) BayesianNetwork.ipynb'
